What Are Bitcoin Mixers?

Bitcoin mixers (also known as crypto tumblers) are services that improve the privacy of cryptocurrency transactions. While Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, mixers break the link between sender and receiver by combining multiple users' funds and redistributing them.

The best BTC mixers use techniques like CoinJoin, time delays, and no-logs policies to ensure that your financial history cannot be easily traced. They are essential tools for anyone who values financial privacy in the digital age.
